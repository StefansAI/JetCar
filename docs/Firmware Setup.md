JetCar runs on the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack">Jetpack</a> image provided by NVIDIA. Several different versions are available for download and there is a lot of other information to find.
<br><br>

The versions have progressed since the start of this project, which was based on 4.4.1. So far the scripts and the code itself has not been tested on a newer version, so it's best to stick with it for now. That SD card image is still available for download in the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-sdk-441-archive">archive section.</a>

The preparation is exactly the same as described on this <a href="https://jetbot.org/master/software_setup/sd_card.html">JetBot page</a>, just use the jetpack image instead. Flash the image with the <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher">Balena Etcher</a>, plug the card into the Jetson Nano, connect monitor, mouse and keyboard and boot the system.<br><br>

At initial startup, the system will go through several typical setup dialogs including Wi-Fi setup. It doesn't have to be done from the command line.
